In 2012 I bought a running watch with GPS capabilities. Since then I started logging all my workouts on [Nike+](http://www.nike.com/es/es_es/c/nike-plus). By the way, at that time, they had a really poor web application (i.e., it didn't provide links to share runs or any information regarding altitude, no way to download raw information or accessing it via APIâ€¦). Later in 2012, Nike+ opened its mind and [launched the Nike+ Accelerator program](http://news.nike.com/news/nike-launches-first-accelerator-program), a new initiative involving third parties to reuse its APIs. Under this program, selected developers could access and reuse data coming from Nike+ APIs to develop innovative products and services. After that, some new applications and integrations with other platforms were created. Good idea, but too selective because **only official Nike+ developers have access to the APIs**. In the meantime, a few enthusiasts such as Matt Stuehler [did a good job](https://mattstuehler.com/lab/NikePlus/) enabling users to download all their workouts as [GPX](http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp) files. These developers couldn't follow Nike's updates and had to stop their services.

Now I use a TomTom GPS Watch but I still keep my runs synchronized with Nike+. TomTom is much better in terms of compatibility and standards. You can do whatever you want with **your** data. So, in this sense TomTom rocks! 

After seeing some [appealing visualization examples](http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/09/nike-plus-running-data.html) I've tried to represent all my running workouts and races during these years. **More than 16,000 Km** around the world (mostly Europe) shown in just 30 seconds. See [the result](https://espinr.github.io/running/viz.html) focused on my city, where I ran the most.

## How I did it

[SmashRun](http://smashrun.com) is a great web application to analyse massive running data. It has fantastic features for statistics lovers. After linking my Nike+ service with SmashRun I have [an appealing dashboard](http://smashrun.com/espinr) with all my info.

SmashRun keeps the data centralized on their servers, but you cannot access to the raw information yet :-/ 

[Tapiriik](https://tapiriik.com/) is a web service aiming at keeping synchronized third-party fitness platforms. This tool enabled me to save thousands of runs in GPX format from SmashRun to [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) in seconds. As a result: **586 MBytes in 2.139 GPX files**.

Using [a Python script](https://github.com/espinr/TCX-to-text), all this information was merged into just one large file (53 MBytes) with the minimum information (dates and coordinates) representing thousands of kilometres. 

After that, the file was uploaded to [Carto](https://carto.com) and represented on [the map](https://espinr.carto.com/viz/f9333dd6-cc50-11e6-834e-0e05a8b3e3d7/map).  

See [another example](https://espinr.github.io/running/tracks.html), now with the complete lines with tracks:
